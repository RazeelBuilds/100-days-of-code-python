# Day 03 - Treasure Island Game 🏝️

Welcome to **Day 3** of my [100 Days of Code - Python](https://github.com/razeelbuilds/100-days-of-code-python) challenge!

Today’s project is a **text-based adventure game** called **Treasure Island**. The game takes the player through a series of choices to find hidden treasure. One wrong move leads to "Game Over" — but the right path leads to victory! 🏆
