# Day 05 - PyPassword Generator 🔐

Welcome to **Day 5** of my [100 Days of Code - Python](https://github.com/RazeelBuilds/100-days-of-code-python) challenge!

This project is a **Python-based random password generator** that helps users create **strong, secure passwords** directly in the terminal. You can specify how many **letters**, **symbols**, and **numbers** you want, and the script will build a randomized, shuffled password that’s safe and unpredictable — perfect for beginners learning Python and working on real-world logic.

- Building simple but powerful command-line utilities
