# Day 04 - Rock Paper Scissors Game 🎮

Welcome to **Day 4** of my [100 Days of Code - Python](https://github.com/razeelbuilds/100-days-of-code-python) challenge!

Today’s project is a classic terminal game — **Rock Paper Scissors**, built using basic Python tools. The player chooses between rock, paper, or scissors, and the computer randomly selects its own. ASCII art is used to visualize each move, and the game logic determines the winner.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Using the `random` module to generate unpredictable outcomes
- Handling user input and validating it
- Implementing game logic with `if-elif-else` statements
- Storing related data using lists (ASCII art, choices)
- Printing multi-line strings for a better user interface

---

## ⚙️ Features

- Fully interactive CLI-based game
- Randomized computer choice
- ASCII art visuals for rock, paper, and scissors
- User-friendly messages and input feedback
- Handles invalid numeric input gracefully
