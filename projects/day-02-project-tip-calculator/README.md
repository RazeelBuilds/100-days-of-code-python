# Tip Calculator 💰

Tip Calculator is a simple and interactive command-line Python project that helps users calculate how much each person should pay when splitting a bill, including a customizable tip percentage. Built using basic Python concepts like `input()`, type conversion, arithmetic operations, and the `round()` function and `f-strings` for formatted output, this project was created as part of the [100 Days of Code – The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) by Dr. Angela Yu on Udemy.
